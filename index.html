					<h2 id="Info">Background</h2>
					<p>Nelson Mandela, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela in the full name, was born on July 18th, 1918, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a>. He is the first black president of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a>. He is a son of Henry Mandela, the chief of Madiba clan. Mandela’s father died when he was age 7, so his uncle took him in. He attended the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Fort_Hare">University of Fort Hare</a>, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a>n Native College at that time. In 1941, he got expelled from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Fort_Hare">University of Fort Hare</a> because he lead a group of students on a political strike. Two years later, he enrolled at the University of Witwatersrand and studied law. He was qualified for a lawyer after he passed the qualification test. He later joined ANC(African National Council) in 1944.</p>

					<h2 id="What">What he tried to change</h2>
					<p>Nelson Mandela grew up learning about racial discrimination in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a>. He was against <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid">apartheid</a>, legislation on segregation of different races. He fought for freedom and equality for his country. This wasn’t easy though. NP, <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_(South_Africa)">National Party</a>, kept resisting and blocking Mandella. As Mandella started gathering more people, <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_(South_Africa)">National Party</a> kept enforcing more and more laws against ANC. He was banned from travel, association, and speech in 1992. And he was arrested twice in 1956 and 1963.</p>
					
					<h2 id="Strats">Strategies used</h2>
					<p>Nelson was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violent protests. In 1952, he did a defiance act against <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid">apartheid</a> and lawyered black people, specializing in cases on <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid">apartheid</a> legislation. He also drafted a “Freedom Charter”, a document containing principals of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a>n Congress Alliance. However, he got arrested in 1956 because of an enforced law on protesters against <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid">apartheid</a>. On top of that, the shooting of unarmed black citizens made Nelson put down non-violent protests and move on to violent styles. He went to Algeria to practice guerrilla warfare and sabotage in 1962. He returned to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a> a year later and got arrested shortly. Nelson almost got a death penalty for firearms possession and uprising, but he nearly evaded it and got a life sentence instead. While he was imprisoned, he started to gather crowds that support him. In 1990, he was released by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a>n government. Four years later, in 1994, he was elected as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a>’s president in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a>’s first democratic election. He immediately started making changes to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a> by creating TRC, Truth and Reconciliation Commission. It was created to investigate human rights violations. Also, he improved black people’s life by providing them housing, education, and economic development.</p>

					<h2 id="Result">Results of his work</h2>
					<p>Nelson Mandela successively ended <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid">apartheid</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a>. He is still admired by people around the world and is a symbol of dedication, sacrifice, and courage. He resigned from his presidential career in 1997 and retired from politics. However, he remained a strong international figure. After his retirement, he founded “the Elders”, a group consisting of international leaders. Also, he found the Nelson Mandela Foundation in 1999. He also became a vocal advocate for AIDS. 11 years later, Mandela's day was created on his birthday to honor his legacy.</p>

					<h2 id="History">What does history say?</h2>
					<p>The world is very positive about Nelson Mandela and thinks he is a symbol of dedication, sacrifice, and courage. The critics say he contributed a lot to society with his actions and will inspire other leaders. Many organizations took up his HIV/AIDS advocation and there also are organizations that took up his legacy in equality and freedom.</p>
